# NFL dataproject

American football players are tall, big, and earn a lot of money. 

Even if you do not know anything about the American national sport, these statements are probably not too far from your own idea of the sport and its players. 

This paper will examine just how big American football players in the National Football League (NFL) are and how much money they make. Do bigger players make more money? How different are the body types of the players when sorting by positions? Which position suits your body type the best? 

"DownloadData.ipynb" is provided to see how we downloaded the data in the first place.

As we have downloaded the data to the folder already , the code in "DataProject" should be running without the need to run the "DownloadData" itself.
